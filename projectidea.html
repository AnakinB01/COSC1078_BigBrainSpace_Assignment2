          <h2>Overview:</h2>
          <p>
            The IT project we have decided to proceed with as a group entails
            creating a web based application where users can access 3D
            renderings and VR models of interior designs for commercial and
            residential housing applications. These models will be accessible
            for the user to view from a VR headset or through their own device
            via an on screen view. The VR headsets will be available for
            purchase and are also in local Real Estates where clients are able
            to view property instead of travelling. We will also have options
            for clients who are constructing their property. They will be
            required to submit the floorplan of the house, which includes the
            measurements and labelling of rooms, and also the specifications for
            their interior (if they also want to see how their house might look
            after its completed).

        <div class="motivation">
          <h2>Motivation:</h2>
          <p>
            Due to the recent events of Covid-19 and the hussle of our clients,
            we are motivated to create a Virtual house and interior option that
            can be viewed providing a fully immersive experience like going to
            the physical location. Due to the travel limits and no house
            inspections running at the time, our clients found it difficult to
            make a decision regarding the purchase of the property. This also
            provides efficiency in general, this will save time for clients as
            they will not be required to travel long distances.

          <h2>Description:</h2>
          <p>
            The project aims to create a new way of being able to view and
            create interior designs and houses without the need to go to the
            physical house. Also people who are building their homes, will be
            able to check how the colours they have selected will look, and
            whether that’s how they wanted their house to look. The virtual
            reality headset is a head mounted device that gives the wearer a
            whole new experience. The VR headset will be a model of the exterior
            only and will not demonstrate the interior components and
            specifications. The VR headset itself will be simple and minimal in
            design while ensuring it also provides comfort for the users. The
            material of the headset also has to be durable yet lightweight, the
            headset can be plastic to prevent it from breaking when hit or
            dropped. It will include a secure head strap possibly with a rubbery
            material that supports the back of the head with soft padding to
            eliminate discomfort, the head strap will be easily adjustable due
            to the material, the head strap will also be a weight distribution
            to balance the front heaviness that creates discomfort overtime. The
            face cover will be a soft material with possibly leather material to
            prevent soaking of sweat and reduce light leakage. The speakers for
            the headset will be an over-ear design to provide high quality
            surround sound that will deliver better immersion and experience.
            The eye pieces will also be adjustable for the different IPD -
            interpupillary distance (distancing between the centre of both eyes)
            of users to create maximum comfort. The features of the VR headset
            aim to work together to create a minimal and comfortable device that
            gives an immersive experience for the users to view the modern
            interior designs stimulating the real world. The Virtual house or
            interior design will be modern, it will be based on the customer’s
            requests and their desired floor plan designs and will include all
            the necessary rooms that’s in a traditional house. The interior
            design will not only be attractive and pleasing to look at, it will
            also ensure that it will be fully functional and to proper scale
            just like a real house. When viewing the interior design, the user
            will be placed in a virtual house that is a copy of the real house
            that stimulates the real world. The house will include multiple
            windows to provide natural lighting and also lights in the house for
            proper lighting. The house will aim to have a wide colour choice to
            make features and room look appealing and also the colours will be
            depended to create the environment of the rooms, the colour choice
            will be fully customisable from the consumer requests. The rooms
            will be fully furnished to provide a finished view of the house
            which can also be changed freely by the customer’s requests The
            interior designs can also be viewed on a computer or mobile device
            but without the immersion. By creating this project, it can allow
            people to go experience houses without ever needing to go to the
            place. The headset can also be used as a regular VR headset to view
            movies and play games. The interior designs can provide Real Estates
            with opportunities such as virtual tours where people can have the
            option of viewing interior designs without the need to physically go
            there. This can also bring in opportunities of creating ‘Virtual
            Holidays’ for people that lack time to travel or unable to travel.

        <div class="tools">
          <h2>Tools + Tech:</h2>
          <p>
            The tools used to create the headset model will be ‘Blender’, which
            is free 3D computer graphics software for modelling and animating
            that can render high quality models. The software used to create the
            interior designs will be using the browser-based platform called
            ‘Floorplanner’. Floorplanner is a website for people to create
            interior designs from scratch, it is different from our idea as
            Floorplanner is essentially like a simplified CAD software that
            provides you with the tools to create your own designs. The website
            can create simple VR compatible interior designs with full 3D
            rendered and designed furniture without modelling designs from
            scratch. The final rendered designs will be showcased on our website
            which can be accessed using a VR headset or with a mobile device or
            pc. The tools used to create the website include the use of software
            including text editors such as Sublime Text 3 and Visual Studio
            Code. These text editors allow us to manipulate and add to HTML and
            CSS files which allow us to populate data and alter styling for our
            website. We also used multiple text editor extensions like Live
            Server which allowed us to see real-time changes within the website
            while we altered the code. Furthermore, we also used Github as a
            host for our repository where we stored all the HTML and CSS files
            and used Github Pages to create and host our website through these
            files. What differentiates us from the floorplanner application is
            that we act as the ‘middle-man’ in the virtual experience for
            commercial and residential properties. The floorplanner application
            requires users to create the interior designs and renderings from
            scratch, meaning this consumes the time of the customer or real
            estate agent listing and displaying the renderings and property to
            clients as they have to develop the design. What we will do and what
            sets us apart from the Floorplanner application is that we use an
            architectural plan or current property to design the VR Model in
            floorplanner without having the Real Estate Agency/ Property
            Developer making it, then we can display these renderings through
            our web based application where the users can view their models in
            VR. If the client does not have access to VR software and the
            property is being designed or sold through Real Estate Agencies/
            Property Development companies, the client/user can go to these
            companies and view their design through their equipment. This
            example leads very well into using our application for open houses
            abroad, for example if someone is moving into another state or area
            in their country and they cannot attend the open house, they can
            view the property in VR from the comfort of their home or local real
            estate agency.

        <div class="skills">
          <h2>Skills:</h2>
          <p>
            Creating the Virtual Reality headset model requires the skill of
            planning and developing a headset design, it requires research of
            possible competitor headsets, the materials and the features to
            provide maximum comfort and immersiveness and also ensuring the
            model is not only aesthetically pleasing but also considers the
            functionality and the comfort of the users for the final product.
            Creating the 3D model with Blender requires the skill of knowing how
            to model 3D objects with the software from scratch, being able to
            create the different surfaces and lightings for the final render
            model and most importantly ensures proper proportions and scaling of
            the VR headset model. For creating the interior designs, the crucial
            skills that are necessary is to have ideas and knowledge of colours
            - what colours creates contrast and how it affects the
            environment/mood around you. The knowledge of design trends and
            styles and have to be creative and attention to detail in order to
            create designs that are eye-catching yet practical that satisfies
            the consumers. Skills required for ‘Floorplanner’ are knowing how to
            use the web platform and making sure the interior is to scale to a
            real floor plan and interior design. There are quite a few skills
            required for the creation of the website. Firstly, basic knowledge
            of HTML files and their structure and tags assists the developer in
            creating a segmented layout with classes and divs for example which
            can be utilized by CSS to generate a nice layout. Secondly as
            touched on before, knowledge of CSS and how to manipulate certain
            attributes allows the user to create an appealing website and thus
            is key. Thirdly, knowledge of the use of text editors and allocating
            files to repositories held within GITHUB for example with correct
            file path referencing within the files is key as this allows the
            developer to successfully link HTML and CSS together within a
            repository. Finally, general skills such as knowledge of contrasting
            font and colour options as well as systematic and effective layout
            designs help the developer create a more appealing website and thus
            is a key skill.

        <div class="outcome">
          <h2>Outcome:</h2>
          <p>
            The accomplishment of the goal of this project will create a new
            opportunity for Real Estate Agencies and clients to design their
            homes and be able to view and experience the interior design in a
            Virtual Reality headset that will be provided in local Real Estates
            or at the comfort of your own house with your own Virtual Reality
            headset or through a web browser. The success of this project will
            bring about a more efficient and flexible way of conducting property
            inspections, not just that but it will also save time and money of
            travelling if the property is located at a distance, especially due
            to the travel limitations applied during the lockdown. Our project
            also gives clients the possibility to view the interior of their
            property, through which they can decide whether that's what they
            want to proceed with, which will give them maximum satisfaction once
            their construction is complete. The success of this project will
            provide a whole new virtual, surreal and immersive experience.
