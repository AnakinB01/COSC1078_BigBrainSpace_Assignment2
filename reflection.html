                Our group has great communication and can get their assigned sections
                done by a certain date, everyone worked efficiently and completed the
                tasks to a satisfactory level. The team did not experience any major
                issues but a thing that can improve is probably having a better
                Microsoft Teams meeting time so that everyone can be on at the same time
                however it is sometimes difficult due to work and other situations. It
                is surprising that the team has good communication and teamwork skills
                where the group can communicate in ease and cooperate with the work. One
                thing learnt from the team is that everyone has different preferences of
                doing the work, for example, I personally like completing the work as
                early as possible and not leaving it to the last minute. Our Microsoft
                Team meetings are great, we can communicate with each other and analyse
                what needs to be done and set goals before the end of the week. The
                group has also set up a task/to do list on GitHub where we can keep
                track of what needs to be completed and what has already been done. The
                documentation and Microsoft Teams meetings and details are all on a
                google drive where we use google doc to write the assignment.

                Our group “BigBrainSpace” used it's time very effectively when
                completing the documentation and the website. All work was equally
                divided amongst the members and specific deadlines were set. The team
                had weekly meetings to make sure everyone is on track. These meetings
                were also a good time to clarify any problems or questions anyone had.
                One thing that could be improved for this group is that it’s important
                for all group members to be present to all team meetings. This will help
                make sure that no one misses out on any vital information discussed
                during the meeting. One thing that was surprising was that the same
                couple of people were always on task, completed their section on time
                and turned up to all team meetings. One thing that I have learnt about
                this group is that ndividual’s like to work on specific parts of the
                documentation. All documentation work was stored on google drive
                available for members to access at any time. GitHub was very useful for
                the website because it allowed users to assign sections to members of
                the team and it also had a task manager which we found useful. The group
                continued to use the method of Microsoft Teams for communication
                purposes, meeting recordings and file uploads.

                My group “Big Brain Space”, has worked very efficiently throughout the
                assignment, and we used our time very effectively as we had different
                members assigned to different tasks within the report and the website
                and we also had a due date by which the task must be completed, which
                allowed us to progress throughout this assignments without any major
                issues. The group had weekly meetings which were organised and attended
                through Microsoft teams, where we had a set agenda to discuss , allowing
                us to stay on track with the report and the website, however not all
                team members were present in the meetings all the time, which is
                something we could improve on. The one thing that surprised me was, how
                most members finished the task within the timeframe given, despite
                having other assignments. The one thing I have learned about the group
                is that not everyone has the same level of preferences, when working on
                the report. For example, I liked to work more on the IT technologies
                section, while others liked to work in the Industry Data section or the
                project idea section. In terms of the tools used for the assignment, we
                had all our documents on a google drive, which could be accessed by all
                members, we also had Github setup, within which we used the task manager
                to assign different tasks to members of the group. That tool was very
                useful for us, as we could who needed to complete what. We also used
                Microsoft teams for communication and meetings and for links to GitHub
                or images which will be used in the website. We also used Facebook
                Messenger for communication purposes, and that is where we mostly
                communicate with one another.

                What I believe our group was able to achieve well was the communication
                side of things, we were able to communicate well and efficiently with
                each other and discuss what needed to be done. The assignment was able
                to be completed quickly as we were able to split the workload evenly
                between each group member. Things I think that could have been improved
                upon was making sure that everyone attended the discussed meeting times.
                As one of our group members was unable to join the meetings a majority
                of the time due to personal reasons. One thing I found surprising was
                how quickly our group was able to allocate work evenly across the group,
                and how we all agreed towards it. One thing that I learned about groups
                is that people like to work at different paces such as some like to
                finish their work quickly while others may like to spread out their
                work. We used microsoft teams to help plan meetings and to record them,
                we used facebook messenger to keep in touch with each other and to give
                reminders of what needs to be done and used github to help keep track of
                what needs to be done, in progress and completed.

                The group that I was fortunate enough to be a part of for assignment two
                was named ‘BigBrainSpace’. What allowed us to work so profficentely on
                this assignment was through the individual dedication and teamwork
                displayed by each group member. We were able to work efficiently and
                delegate tasks to each member without any complications, which further
                allowed us to reduce the individual workload on specific members and
                create a more inclusive project displaying everyone’s strengths. The
                group further utilised tools and software such as Microsoft teams to
                conduct weekly meetings and allow members to provide progress reports
                and issues and concerns that need to be addressed. We did have some
                issues with attendance in the meetings, this was due to a number of
                external factors. To better strengthen and improve this aspect in the
                future, creating a set schedule that was the same over the weeks where
                everyone is available would be good. One thing that was surprising is
                everyone’s ability to utilise shared places such as google drive for
                everyone to access work relating to the assignment. The use of Google
                docs allowed us to create assignment documentation that everyone could
                add to and work on. Another tool we used for shared data storage was
                Github repositories. This tool allowed users to upload their plain HTML
                sections for incorporation into final CSS work and Github pages
                integration. We also used the project planner through Github to keep
                track of tasks. One thing I have learned about groups is that the
                overall success of the group is dependent on the group members and when
                everyone works well together and is able to communicate efficiently, the
                group tasks succeed and the assignment can be completed ahead of
                schedule like in our case.

                With our group <strong>“BigBrainSpace”</strong> we believe that we
                managed time effectively and efficiently, everyone completed their
                sections before the deadlines. The written report was completed a week
                early prior to the due date which gives us time to work and finish our
                group website for submission. Our team had great communication, we are
                able to plan meetings through Microsoft Teams and update or let each
                other know what needs to be completed through Facebook Messenger. If we
                ever had problems we would resolve conflict effectively, everyone will
                come to an agreement with no arguments. We also have great teamwork by
                helping each other on the different sections and completing the work
                together, no one is “assigned” to individual work, everyone will
                contribute to sections that need help. One thing that could be improved
                for this group is that each member of the group must turn up to the
                group meetings. This is because one of the team member was always absent
                during the team meetings. This will ensure that everyone is aware of
                what gets discussed during the meeting. It will also be a good time for
                each member to share their contribution of ideas for the project. If
                anyone runs into any issues this would be a great time to solve the
                issue. One thing that was surprising would be that we were able to
                communicate very well, whether that was using Microsoft Teams or
                Facebook Messenger, and because of this all the tasks were assigned and
                finished without any major issues. Also another thing that was
                surprising was that group members were able to finish their tasks within
                the allotted time, which was decided by the group, this helped us
                swiftly progress through the sections of assignment. One thing that was
                learned about groups is that if time is taken to plan out what will be
                discussed during meetings, and during those meetings the discussion does
                not go off topic the group work will go smoothly, and there will be less
                instances of people in the group not knowing what needs to be done.
                Other things that were discovered about groups is that not every member
                of the group works the same way, some like to get all of their work done
                and out of the way while others may like to divide their work throughout
                the deadline. Our group made a to-do-list/task list on GitHub where we
                are able to keep track on what needs has been completed and what we need
                to work on. Everyone has also written and uploaded separate HTML of the
                report into GitHub repository and we will combine it and add CSS for the
                final website.
