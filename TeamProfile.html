<h2>Gordon Hu</h2>
<p>My name is Gordon Hu, my student number is S3897271, I was born in Australia, my nationality is Chinese. I have graduated high school and currently a student studying the ‘Bachelor of Information Technology’ at RMIT. I can speak 3 languages – Chinese, English and Shanghai dialect. My greatest joys are spending time with family and friends, and spending my free time playing video games with friends. My father is an IT programmer at Hansen Technologies, I have been observing him from a young age therefore gaining interest in IT and technologies and having a dream of being like him in the future. I have also grown up with Nintendo systems such as the Gameboy, DS, Wii to the Switch which builds my IT interest, and recently I have purchased an Oculus Quest that has intrigued me to learn more about IT and the world of technology. </p>

<h2>Rishi Patel</h2>
<p>My name is Rishi Patel, my student number is s3895902. I was born in India and my nationality is also Indian. I graduated from high school last year and I am currently studying Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT. I am really passionate about cricket, and in my spare time i am usually playing with a bat or ball, i also love listening to meaningful songs, which have great lyrics. My interest in IT started, when I saw one of my friends writing code and making programs. The two areas of IT which I have great interest in are Software Development, because i am really interested in programming and designing of applications and Cyber Security because i found it really cool about how we can control and manipulate other devices (not that i am going to do anything like that).  </p>

<h2>Robert Tattersall</h2>
<p>I’m a first-year bachelor of IT student at RMIT, born and currently living in Frankston, Victoria. I went to Elisabeth Murdoch College, and graduated in 2019, where I was interested in subjects such as English, PE and obviously IT. The focus in our IT curriculum was informatics, so I have an affinity for database design and usage. I enjoy working out, listening to new music and travelling. No, I am not related to Tattslotto, but would certainly like to be because those fellas are loaded.</p>

<h2>Friba Dowlatshahi</h2>
<p>I was born in 1998 in Jaghori Afghanistan and moved to Australia in 2005. I am from the Hazara ethnic group. I was 7 years old when I left my home country. When I moved to Australia I had absolutely no idea how to speak or write English, so basically, I started from zero. My mother tongue is Farsi which I speak at home. I completed my primary school and high school in Australia. Currently, I am in my final semester studying Bachelor of Business Information systems at RMIT. I am the first from my family to get into a university which is very accomplishing and rewarding. One fact that people may be interested to know about me is that sometimes I collect a lot of cups in my room. This is because I drink a lot of tea and the cups just seem to float everywhere around my room. Additionally, I enjoy a good Netflix binge but can also be found on long road trips with friends or on a big shopping haul.</p>

<h2>Mark Kovach </h2>
<p>
My name is Mark Kovach, my student number is s3898475. I was born in Australia and live in the western suburbs. I am the youngest of 2 brothers with my oldest brother having a baby girl. My nationality is Croatian, and my last name translated into English is “Blacksmith”. I am a first-year student at RMIT studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I decided to study at RMIT mainly because I have an interest in technology and IT, and wish to learn more about it, so studying at a university that is named for its involvement in technology and things about it was a no brainer for me. Also, an upside would be that it is easy for me to get to. Some hobbies I have are to play and watch soccer (football). I started playing soccer when I was around 6-9. Another hobby I have is to play the guitar. I have been playing the guitar for around 5 years. Other hobbies I have are to watch tv shows, anime and play video games. Some of my favorite tv shows and anime are Avatar the Last Airbender, How I Met Your Mother, Your Lie in April, Hunter x Hunter and Full-metal Alchemist Brotherhood. Some games that I enjoy are CSGO, Undertale, binding of Isaac Rebirth, Spelunky and Pokémon.</p>

<h2>Anakin Bawden</h2>
<p>My name is Anakin Bawden and my RMIT student number is S3906456. I was born in the regional city of Ballarat, roughly 120km from Melbourne’s western side. Currently I am in my first year of studying a bachelor of information technology at the city campus of RMIT. Hobbies of mine include aviation which i have been involved with all my life with dad having his pilot's license, also i have a very high interest in IT especially the inner workings of computer systems and ways in which these are exploited by people. I also enjoy hanging with my friends and playing video games online, especially the likes of CS:GO and Escape from tarkov to name a few. My IT interest has stemmed from being an active user of devices from a very young age and the countless hours reading and studying about how these devices work and how their operation could eventuate a career. In terms of IT experience, i have self taught myself most of my current knowledge through online courses and experimentation, but i also currently have a position working in the Tech area at my local Good guys store in ballarat which has provided me with additional skills and insights into the world of IT. Later down the line i would like to pursue a career in cyber security and protecting worldwide assets and data through threat mitigation and analysis.</p>

<h2>Gordon Hu</h2>
<p>
    The results of these tests represent what type of person I am, it gives a rough overview of myself and the strength and weaknesses that I have. It also demonstrated my abilities and skills when working in a group so by understanding that would be crucial to consider when creating a team. 
    From the tests it shows that I have reliable and patient, imaginative, observant and analytical skills which will allow me to have great teamwork abilities and to get the job done. However, the tests show that I am introverted and shy which will create a lack of communication that will influence my behaviour in a team. 
    When forming a team, I should consider opening up and engaging in finding a team and introducing myself first, finding people that I can be myself to and become confident in order to use all the positive skills to support the team. Also shown from the ‘learning style test’, my learning preference is kinaesthetic which suggests that when forming a team there should be different people with different learning preference in the group to complete the different parts of the project more efficiently.

    The result of the personality test reveals that I am Extraverted when it comes to interacting within an environment. This is a real positive for me because my ideal job requires me to interact with a variety of people, whether that be the developer team or the executives or the clients, being extraverted means that I can sufficiently communicate and interact with them, which will bring more clarity into the work, and will help me and my team deliver a better product. The test also reveals that I tend to make decisions that are driven by feelings rather than thinking, which could sometimes affect the way I do things, and this could prove to be a very weak point in a working environment. However the test also shows that I am very Judging, which means that I am very systematic and that I take deadlines very seriously, which will help me deliver products on time to the clients. Therefore when forming a team, I would prefer to have people who have quite similar traits to mine, people who take deadlines seriously and are very open within a team environment. But I would also love to have members who have complete opposite traits as that allows for a more open discussion in terms of ideas, projects etc.

The results of the online Myers-Briggs test have identified my personality type as a “Protagonist” ENFJ-A. Results showed that I am a person with the extraverted, intuitive, feeling and judging personality traits (16 Personalities 2021). Also, I am a forthright type of person who loves assisting people. My perspective is backed by the creative energy (56%) to achieve objectives (16 Personalities 2021). Similarly, based on further research about my personality, I identified that Malala Yousafzai who is the youngest Nobel prize winner and who I truly inspire also has a protagonist personality type. Protagonists are tolerant, reliable and a natural leader (16 Personalities 2021) this means I can confidently take leadership roles.
 
Based on the learning style test, I have discovered that I am a person who desires to learn in a pragmatist style. The results show that pragmatists like to try new ideas, experiment, act fast and confidently on ideas while getting straight to the point instead of having long discussions (Emtrain 2016). There are specific learning methods that a pragmatist prefers such as practicals and case studies (Emtrain 2016).      
 
Finally, the last test that was chosen to be undertaken was the IPIP Big five personality tests. As we can see from the above table, the highest I scored was in Factor IV. This factor is labelled as Conscientiousness. People such as me who score high on the IV factor are considered to be careful and diligent (Open-Source Psychometrics Project 2019). I believe this is a true characteristic of me.

    The four tests that i undertook were the Myer Briggs Personality Test, Vark Questionnaire, Education Planner Test and the DISC Personality Test. The results of the first test concluded that I attained the personality of a protagonist. The personality code was stated as ENFJ-A/ENFJ-T. This result showed me that I am extroverted while being more intuitive and judging of people. I also am quite assertive and full of passion and charisma. Protagonists are also stated to be very altruistic but they can also be overly idealistic and have ‘grand plans’. The Myer Briggs test also highlights to myself that this personality is commonly associated with people in leadership roles and the workplace habits this personality holds is being hard working and determined, but they must keep control of their ambitious and idealistic ideas.

The Vark Questionnaire and the Education Planner Test highlighted to me that I learn through a Mild-Visual way. The way I learn is targeted to be through graphs, pictures and physical demonstrations  and the learning style allows users to have strong memory retention which assists in learning faster. Another feature is that Visual learners can be multi-modal on demand which means they can switch between differential learning styles to accommodate the needs or requirements of a group/task. This can be a real strength when it comes to developing a team.

Finally, the results of the DISC Personality Test highlighted to me the composition of my personality through 4 deciding factors, the main being the Dominance sector with a rating of 50%. This means that a great portion of my personality is through asserting myself and dealing with problems. The other factors were significantly less than the sector of Dominance but they highlighted that these test results allowed users to respond to challenges in a practical, enthusiastic and realistic manner. It also stated that users are very fact orientated with being assertive and individualistic.

<h2>Mark Kovack</h2>
<p>The results of each test was not very surprising for me, as for the learning style test, I find it much easier to learn things if someone shows me how it is done and uses examples rather than someone explaining to me how something is done. The results in these tests should not affect the way I behave while working in a team. While working in a team I like to participate or contribute as much as anyone else, carrying my weight and not having to let others do my work because I am unable to complete it. While forming a team I would like to look for people that are willing to put in effort and carry their own weight themselves as I do not like having to do extra work because someone else is slacking. I find that it is fair if everyone participates equally.

    My personality test revealed me as a “protagonist”, with an even spread of traits and my role and strategy both being related to working with people, being diplomat and people mastery respectively, which relate to understanding and empathising with others. I am a pragmatic and methodical person but enjoy abstract thinking when usable, which I believe explains the evenly spread personality traits. I consider myself a compassionate person and try my best to understand and work with others to the best of my ability, so I consider this to be fairly accurate. 
    These tests reveal to me that I am largely spread over several different qualities, with no standout styles of thinking and learning being favoured, and that I am not highly open minded. I interpret not being open minded as not trying new things as often as I could, which I can agree with. A takeaway could be to try new learning styles and be more creative in my approach to some problems. In a team situation, these results tell me that I have the mentality to be able to understand and cooperate effectively with others in a team, and I would like myself to be open to others and feel they can trust me to voice new ideas or concerns. When forming a team I should take great effort to be approachable and take effort to create an environment where people feel secure to discuss ideas, and I should try to make communication as clear as possible.
