            As a group, our opinions about our ideal jobs haven't changed,
            because all our ideal jobs are in good demand from employers, and
            they also include skills which are most demanded by employers. For
            example IT skills such as Java, C and SQL are all part of our ideal
            jobs, and these skills are in good demand. Other than IT skills, our
            ideal jobs have a common general skill which is required, and that
            is communication skills, which is a great skill to have regardless
            of the job one is applying for. All in all our opinions about our
            ideal jobs have not changed.
