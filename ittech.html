        <h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="autowhat">
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <p>
          Autonomous vehicles are more commonly known as self driving cars or
          driverless cars where the cars can drive itself from one location to
          another location without human involvement. The vehicles have installed
          sensors, radars, GPS, machine learning and various amounts of technologies
          that allow auto driving (Wikipedia 2021). Autonomous cars work by creating
          and maintaining a map of their surroundings based on the variety of
          sensors located in different parts of the vehicle, the sensors also detect
          nearby vehicles and sensors located in the wheels are used to detect the
          road and other vehicles when parking.
          
          Video cameras are used to detect
          traffic lights, road signs, track other vehicles, and look for pedestrians
          (Synopsys 2021). “Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors bounce
          pulses of light off the car’s surroundings to measure distances, detect
          road edges, and identify lane markings” (Synopsys 2021, page 1) The
          software then processes all this information and input, creates a path,
          and sends instructions to the car’s actuators, which controls the
          acceleration, braking, and steering. “Encoded rules, obstacle avoidance
          algorithms, predictive modelling, and object recognition help the software
          follow traffic rules and navigate obstacles” (Synopsys 2021, page 1).
          Currently, autonomous vehicles are made available to the public with
          companies such as Tesla, Google, manufacturing them and making them
          available however autonomous vehicles are still expensive and are not
          perfect which requires further development, where in the future the
          technology will be more refined and be made more available for the general
          public. Current cost wise, an autonomous vehicle such as a Tesla for
          example compared to a fuel powered car is more expensive to purchase,
          charging stations are also an issue as they are uncommon compared to
          petrol stations where many people will consider the traditional fuel cars
          instead of electric powered autonomous cars. Currently the technology of
          autonomous vehicles allows cars to drive from one location to another on
          autopilot mode however self driving cars are limited due to the Government
          regulations and that it still requires human manual control whereas, in
          the future, companies aim for vehicles to be fully autonomous and by
          teaching them the “edge cases they’ll encounter on the road” (Vox recode
          2020). Due to cost wise and limitations, autonomous transport is therefore
          used and tested more for large companies and countries. However,
          autonomous transportation is currently being used and is fully functional
          in some countries. Such as autonomous buses or automated shuttles being
          tested in several cities worldwide (ScienceDirect), especially recently
          Singapore has released their first commercial autonomous bus service that
          runs between two routes. In Hong Kong an automated, fully driverless
          transportation or “Automated People Mover” is located within Hong Kong
          International Airport (Wikipedia 2021), it is fully automated and it
          transports people from separate terminals. With the development with other
          new and improved technology it will further make autonomous vehicles more
          efficient, with more sophisticated artificial intelligence being created,
          better sensors to help detect the environment, and by having improved
          network capabilities such as the 5G network it allows higher bandwidth
          where cars will be able to “communicate” with each other and to be able to
          find traffic signals, better more efficient routes and optimising traffic
          patterns (Vox recode 2020). Even though the development of autonomous
          vehicles is beneficial and efficient, it also creates ethical challenges
          or the “Moral Machine Dilemma” (Valiente Mott, page 1). An autonomous
          vehicle is unable to make judgments between two critical outcomes, similar
          to the trolley problem for example, choosing between turning left and
          hitting a roadblock injuring passengers or turning right and hitting
          pedestrians. Researchers have been thinking “should autonomous vehicles
          perhaps adopt utilitarian principles when choosing who lives and who
          dies?” (Digitalist 2019, page 1). Artificial Intelligence could be taught
          ethical decisions however people argue that consumers should have the
          power to decide, therefore autonomous vehicles won’t be perfect.

      <div class="autoimpact">
        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>
          The development of autonomous vehicles will impact society's lifestyles by
          changing our ways of travelling, reducing traffic accidents and creating a
          more eco friendly environment. By having self-driving vehicles, it can
          benefit traffic efficiency and reduce time consumption on the road. This
          development will aim to reduce traffic accidents and improve safety as
          stated by the NRMA that - “94% of accidents are caused by human errors”
          (NRMA, page 1) and can provide greater mobility options that benefit those
          with a disability or elderly (NRMA) by allowing them to be able to drive a
          car without affecting those around them. With sensors and cameras
          installed on the vehicle, it will ensure the car will drive within the
          speed limit, this will prevent people from speeding and also contribute
          towards the prevention of traffic accidents. Autonomous vehicles will
          reduce traffic congestion which means will drop “60% in harmful emissions”
          (Thales 2021, page 1). Autonomous vehicles will provide a more
          environmentally friendly option as self-driving cars such as Tesla are
          powered using electricity instead of petrol or diesel created from fossil
          fuels where this change will reduce carbon dioxide emissions. However,
          potential issues are created with the development of autonomous vehicles
          as well. There will be a dramatic job loss problem where by having
          self-driving vehicles, it will replace the current jobs of those who
          depend on driving, such as public transport drivers, food delivery, those
          that rely on driving for a job (Valiente Mott). Autonomous vehicles also
          raise concerns with machine malfunction and error and security issues,
          even though autonomous vehicles will reduce accidents however “it does not
          eliminate the risk of accidents caused by machine error” (Valiente Mott,
          page 1). A small malfunction or security issue can cause major problems
          and danger towards people, traffic can be manipulated, autonomous cars can
          be hacked and can change the speed of a car (Valiente Mott).

        <h2>How will it affect you?</h2>
        <p>
          The development of autonomous vehicles will greatly benefit me and the
          general public as well. The creation of autonomous vehicles can reduce
          time travelling to and from work, it can also allow the increase of car
          sharing which would reduce traffic congestion, which can benefit family
          members and people to reduce time spent on the road. Autonomous vehicles
          will allow elderly people and those with driving impairments in families
          to be able to travel efficiently without worrying about not being able to
          know how to drive a car and affecting those around them (NRMA), and for
          the people that can drive, parking can be a long process trying to find a
          convenient spot however, with the development of autonomous vehicles
          people can arrive outside the location and let the vehicle find a parking
          and later on pick you up. With self parking you also don’t have to worry
          about parking tickets as the car will find a parking spot autonomously and
          change parking after the time limit. It can increase the safety of
          families and people by having sensors and emergency brake functions that
          are able to detect crashes, traffic accidents with a faster reaction time
          than humans which can also decrease the possibility for human error. With
          the sensors and cameras installed, people also don’t have to worry about
          speeding. In an autonomous vehicle, people will no longer need to keep an
          eye out for changing speed limits as the self-driving vehicle will be able
          to gain information and adjust the speed automatically (2025ad).

      <div class="blockwhat">
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way which makes it
          difficult to change, hack or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially
          a digital ledger of transaction, which runs across a massive peer to peer
          network. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and
          every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, the record of that
          is added to every participant’s ledger. Using this technology, users can
          confirm transactions without the need of a central clearing authority. A
          cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is secured by cryptography,
          which makes it nearly impossible to fake or over spend. Many
          cryptocurrencies are decentralized meaning that they have no middle man or
          central authority controlling the transactions. It is based on a network
          of blockchain technology-making it a distributed ledger imposed by
          different devices on a network. There are various cryptocurrencies, but
          the most common ones are bitcoin and ethereum. Bitcoin is stored on a
          digital wallet in a phone or computer. In terms of transaction, one person
          can transfer bitcoins from their wallet to another wallet, and this
          process is recorded on a public blockchain. While bitcoin is more like a
          ledger, Ethereum has a more flexible blockchain. While it does
          documentation and secure transactions from wallet to wallet like bitcoin.
          Developers can use the ethereum blockchain to make a variety of tools from
          software to games (which include spending, lending and trading), which
          exist on a Decentralised Finance (DeFi) application. Decentralised finance
          is a blockchain based form of finance, where no central authority exists.

      <div class="blockimpact">
        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>
          There are various benefits of the blockchain system and cryptocurrency.
          For example, blockchain will allow for faster transactions between two
          parties. Currently most of the services that facilitate payments take a
          couple of days for the transaction to complete, and this time frame could
          increase even further if you are making transactions overseas. This is
          where blockchain comes into play, with the blockchain technology you can
          send money without the need to wait for days for the completion of the
          transaction. Another advantage is product provenance, the blockchain works
          with the supply chain. Any product we buy has to go through a series of
          destinations before we get the product, which increases the chance of
          tampering and fraud with the product. With the help of blockchain usage on
          the supply chain solves all of these problems. Through blockchain the
          companies can keep track of the condition of the product, and if the
          product is tampered with then the system will get alerted and it will
          discard from the supply chain, thus helping consumers receive the product
          they paid for, increasing the authenticity of products. Cryptocurrency
          which runs using the blockchain technology, also has benefits in the
          currency exchange market. The first being that it’s value isn’t affected
          by inflation. A problem with the fiat currency is that governments and
          central banks can manipulate interest rates and issue bonds, which
          increase the supply of the money, resulting in the decrease of purchasing
          power of anyone holding the currency. However unlike fiat currencies,
          cryptocurrency offers a fixed creation schedule and a maximum supply
          limit. Therefore having a currency which can’t be diluted, helping people
          maintain purchasing powers. Another benefit is foreign exchange, currently
          with the central bank (RBA) issued currency is artificially restricted to
          certain geographical locations, but with cryptocurrency that isn’t the
          case, it is a border- free currency. However while there are so many
          positives about blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, there are also
          negative aspects. Blockchain technology is immutable, that means that once
          the data has been entered in the system, it cannot be deleted and this
          could be a big problem arising in terms of privacy. Also immutable
          networks should only be present if the nodes within the network are
          equally distributed, but with blockchain technology if an entity owns 50%
          or more of the nodes, then they can control the network which can make it
          vulnerable for others. A disadvantage of cryptocurrency, would be that
          currently it isn’t regulated or backed by government laws. This would mean
          that it can be exploited by criminals to scam unaware investors, who are
          looking to invest in cryptocurrency.

      <div class="blockaffect">
        <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
        <p>
          Blockchain and cryptocurrency will have major impacts on an individual's
          life. It plays a role in the protection of the customer purchasing items
          online, this is because blockchain technology records everything that
          occurs within the supply chain, which means that when a fraud or damage to
          the product occurs, company’s systems are notified and the product is sent
          back. This way consumers receive the exact product they bought, which will
          increase the level of authenticity in the market. The blockchain system
          shifts the control of some interaction activities from central authorities
          to the users, which improves transparency. For a common man today, sending
          money overseas can be troubling process with the fluctuation of fiat
          currencies and then the banks holding the payment for a few days before
          transferring the money overseas via the SWIFT system, but with blockchain
          and cryptocurrency, this process becomes easier and faster with the
          payment being made and account being settled within 24-48 hours, with no
          central authority controlling the transaction. Also if you are travelling
          to a country who has a higher exchange rate compared to Australia, when
          you get your dollars exchanged for the local currency you might not get
          enough money. This is where crypto currencies will affect the individuals,
          as they are worth the same in every country as it is a border free
          currency.

      <div class="Cloud">
        <h1>Cloud, Servers, services</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="cloudwhat">
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <p>
          A cloud server is an infrastructure that is either in a physical form or
          set up virtually, storing resources, software and data available for users
          who work remotely over a network or the internet (IBM 2019). Cloud servers
          make it easy for any user to have access to the resources from anywhere
          and anytime. All organisational or personal resources, information and
          software are maintained and controlled by the cloud provider servers.
          Cloud servers work via an internet connection, it allows users to access
          and download data on any preferred device such as a laptop, mobile phone
          and tablets. Cloud storage end users can edit, work and upload documents
          and files at the same time if users are working together on projects
          (Fastmetrics 2021). This means all users can be working remotely from
          anywhere in the world which means to some extent physical office sites may
          no longer be required. For an individual user to have access to Cloud
          servers they are required to pay and payments differ from provider to
          provider. With Apple iCloud which most of us are aware of, we can get up
          to 5GB of free cloud storage. For any other amounts of storage, individual
          users can upgrade to a higher storage capacity which they are required to
          make ongoing monthly payments depending on the storage size the user
          selects. However, other service providers pricing models may be different
          and require either yearly or quarterly payments. Furthermore, a Cloud
          server makes business or individual activities much more efficient. For
          instance, there is Fastmetrics, a cloud phone service that provides a
          cloud PBX system (Fastmetrics 2021) on its cloud. A benefit of this server
          is that it gives free video conferencing calls for everyone all around,
          without using software (Fastmetrics 2021). This means that it saves money
          for businesses and individuals, whilst at the same time improving
          productivity and team collaboration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="cloudimpact">
        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>
          The most significant impact of cloud servers comes from the cost savings
          and increased competitiveness of IT services available to individuals and
          businesses (Cloud Watch Hub 2020). Cloud technology may also effectively
          improve other benefits for end-users.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Lower computer cost: </strong></p>
        <p>
          It is not essential to have a high-power computer to operate cloud
          applications. This is because applications operate in the cloud and a
          device does not require the processing capability or hard disk storage
          that is required by modern desktop software (Cloud Watch Hub 2020).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Enhanced Performance: </strong></p>
        <p>
          When fewer programs are running simultaneously, using the computer's
          memory, it will run more effectively. Desktop’s that utilize cloud
          services may possibly boot and operate efficiently as they have fewer
          programs and processes loaded into memory (Cloud Watch Hub 2020).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Easy Team collaboration:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Numerous users can collaborate easily on projects, files, software. All
          resources, software are hosted on the cloud and this can be accessed by
          anyone who has a stable internet connection (Cloud Watch Hub 2020).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unlimited storage:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Cloud services provide virtual storage at an unlimited amount. The current
          hard drive of a computer device is relatively small compared to what a
          cloud server can offer. However, the only downside is that it is not free
          and users who require access to large amounts of storage, are required to
          pay (Cloud Watch Hub 2020).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Device independence:</strong></p>
        <p>
          When a computer user decides to change or upgrade their computer device
          due to whatever reason, there is no requirement for a specific version of
          a program for that particular device. At the same time, there is no
          requirement to save a file in a specific format (Cloud Watch hub 2020).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Availability of different versions:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Doesn’t matter where you access the document from whether it is from home,
          work or the public library, the user can access any versions of the
          document including the last edited document (Cloud Watch Hub 2020).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reduced software costs:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Unlike the pricey software’s out there, cloud computing services can be
          granted for free. Examples of such software include Google Docs, Dropbox
          and Apple iCloud which is appropriate for most individuals (Cloud Watch
          Hub 2020).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Immediate software updates:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Normally Cloud service applications get automatically updated and
          available as soon as the user logs into the cloud service. Usually, when a
          user accesses a cloud-based application, they are presented with the
          latest version and the user is not required to make any updates (Cloud
          Watch Hub 2020).
        </p>

      <div class="cloudaffect">
        <h2>How will it affect you?</h2>
        <p>
          I believe Cloud servers will have a positive effect on me as a student. As
          previously mentioned, Cloud servers have many advantages either for
          storage or computing. Hence, a student like myself can access documents
          and applications from anywhere simply by having an internet connection.
          Alternatively, there is also an option on Google Docs where you can open a
          document with an internet connection and select the option to work
          offline, that way the user can make edits to the document and sync it
          Instead of having hard drives to store documents, programs and
          applications using cloud services are the number one solution. This is the
          safest method of storage in case of fire and other accidental or
          deliberate forms of disasters. Hence, reducing fears of loss of work.
          Cloud servers also provide an easier means of collaboration for IT
          students such as myself because it allows us to work on group assignments
          simultaneously without the need to interrupt one another or the document.
          Furthermore, having virtual servers makes it convenient by allowing
          students to work remotely which in turn makes students more productive and
          attentive. Furthermore, RMIT also provides students with access to
          OneDrive which helps us save disk space on our personal computers.
          Additionally, with the benefit of automatic updates on software and
          applications, it gives us students more time to work on assignments
          instead of having to worry about regularly updating them. Another positive
          side of Cloud servers is that there are Cloud hosting services that have
          special discounts for students.

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, networks,
          information and other devices from threats, such as unauthorised access or
          disclosure of information, attacks from cyber criminals, and maintenance
          and protection of files and hardware. Cybersecurity can be referred to as
          information technology security, computer security or electronic
          information security and can be broken down into subcategories, such as,
          Network security which is the practise of securing a computer network from
          potential intruders and attackers. Application security which focuses on
          the security of softwares and devices. information security which protects
          privacy of data being held. Operational security is the practice of
          protecting data assets and individual pieces of data being aggregated.
          Disaster recovery and business continuity is the practise of a businesses
          responses towards a cyber attack or other related events that results in
          the loss of data, how they recover their operations and information, and
          backup plans the business has to operate with a loss of data. End-user
          education which focuses on the security of people using the system,
          teaching them basic security knowledge so they do not break or damage the
          system accidentally. With technology continuing to be more widespread and
          broad in use, the amount of people's daily reliance of technology has
          increased exponentially year by year. Websites and apps are now a
          requirement for businesses to be successful, some even adopting an
          online-only presence, as the benefits of reaching such a wide audience are
          enough to sway them. With a plethora of businesses now accessible to the
          internet, cybercrime has inevitably grown in frequency and sophistication.
          Common Cyber-attack targets of cybercriminals include passwords, banking
          information and personal information. Cyber-attacks are intentional
          attempts at breaching an information systems integrity and
          confidentiality, which are the accuracy and completeness of data, and the
          protection of sensitive information. There are many ways in which
          cyber-attacks occur, some of which include different types of malware
          which are softwares made to break or damage user’s computers. The
          different types of malware are viruses, which are self replicating
          programs that infect files, Trojans which are disguised as legitimate
          programs, Spyware which records the actions the user takes on their
          computer, and Ransomware which blocks access to files unless a ransom is
          paid. Other cyber-attacks that occur are Man in the middle attacks (MITM)
          which is when an attacker intercepts communication between two people and
          information sent between the two can be retrieved by the attacker. SQL
          injections which is a type of attack that targets vulnerabilities in a
          database by injecting malicious code into the database. Phishing, which is
          an attack that targets people by using emails that look like real
          companies or industries to trick people into revealing sensitive
          information. Denial of service attack (DOS) is an attack that stops a
          service from operating by overwhelming the services with traffic,
          distributed denial of service (DDOS) is the same as DOS but with multiple
          computers flooding the service with traffic.

      <div class="cyberimpact">
        <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
        <p>
          The impact of the advancement of cybersecurity has led to an increase in
          the number of different jobs involving cybersecurity, such jobs include
          cybersecurity analyst which consists of maintaining technology security
          and monitoring traffic in a company's computer network. A penetration
          tester or ethical hacker is where simulated cyber attacks are performed to
          find flaws and gaps in the security of websites and other systems. A
          security software developer who develops security software and implements
          security into applications. Because most if not all people use the
          internet and with it website and web applications, the majority of people
          are affected by what happens with cybersecurity, as some cybersecurity
          experts predict that “in 2021, there will be a cyber attack incident every
          11 seconds”. This increase is because of how important information and
          data is to people. These attacks can be used to stop the services of a
          company or retrieve data such as a person's credit card number and bank
          details. Data breaches impact companies and organisations by damaging
          their reputation and trust between keeping users data safe, and costs the
          organisation a lot of money to repair damaged systems. Organisations that
          fail to update their cybersecurity are not only impacted by data breaches
          caused by cyber attacks but the users themselves who are victims of stolen
          data are also impacted as their own personal data is exposed and can be
          exploited. This causes users to have to change passwords if they have the
          same password for every website they use. If hackers are persistent
          enough, they can target a weaker service that an individual uses and find
          out the password that they use and thus gain access to other services the
          individual uses with the same password even though the service may have
          stronger cybersecurity.

        <h2>How will it affect you?</h2>
        <p>
          Due to the increase in technology used by people around the world and how
          this technology is integrated into our daily lives such as social media
          and work, the effect cybersecurity has on us has increased immensely. With
          how a majority of our lives are online the importance of having strong
          cybersecurity increases. The importance of cybersecurity is clear with how
          without it, a lot if not all of our personal information will be known by
          everyone. The main implementation of cybersecurity that all of us face in
          your daily lives is the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure or
          HTTPS. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP and is an extension used to
          send data between a web browser and a website. However the HTTPS encrypts
          the information sent through the web browser with the use of two different
          keys, the private and public key. The Private key is owned and kept secret
          by the web server and is used to decrypt messages sent, that have been
          encrypted by users of the website using the public key. The Public key is
          a key that is available to all people that connect to the web server and
          encrypts information sent by them. This information can only be decrypted
          by the web servers Private key. Without the use of HTTPS people with the
          right tools are able to view information that has been sent through the
          web browser and website as plain text, while with the use of the protocol
          they will be able to receive the information but it will be viewed as an
          encrypted message that they would not be able to decrypt.
